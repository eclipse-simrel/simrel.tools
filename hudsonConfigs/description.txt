These config files are simply archived here for visibility (and 
possible transfer to other test machines, etc.); they are not 
actually used, from here, during a build. 
Hence they might be "out of date" at any time. 

Remember, to use 'relative' to snag all configs in appropriately named
directories. Such as, on eclipse build machine:

find /shared/jobs -regex ".*/simrel\..*/config.xml" -exec rsync -aR '{}'/ ~/temp   \; 2>/dev/null

This command seems easier: 
scpr -a --relative  build:/shared/jobs/simrel.*/config.xml .

Remember, for HIPP instance, won't have direct file access, so either need to do with
a job, or plugin, or use 
<url to job>/config.xml

Note: latest version is this "shared" directory, actually includes changes needed 
to move to "HIPP" instance. So ... if ever need to "move back" to shared, may want to
backup a version?
