These config files are simply archived here for visibility (and 
possible transfer to other test machines, etc.); they are not 
actually used, from here, during a build. 
Hence they might be "out of date" at any time. 

Remember, to use 'relative' to snag all configs in appropriately named
directories. Such as, on eclipse build machine:

find /shared/jobs -regex ".*/simrel\..*/config.xml" -exec rsync -aR '{}'/ ~/temp   \; 2>/dev/null
