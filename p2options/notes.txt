facts about p2 mirroring.

May need to (essentially) capture literal "console log"?
2>&1 | tee fulllog.txt

An easy "histogrom" one-liner:
grep Selected fulllog.txt | cut -d ":" -f 5- | cut -d "(" -f 2 | cut -d "/" -f 1,2,3 |  sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n


See also
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/HiddenOptions
for some interesting "hidden variables". To quote:

eclipse.p2.max.threads to control the number of active thread. The default is 4.
eclipse.p2.force.threading to enable or disable the multi threaded download. The default is true.
eclipse.p2.mirrors to disable the usage of mirrors when downloading artifacts. The default is true.
