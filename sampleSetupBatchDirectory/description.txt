These files perform in "batch mode" 
bascially what "Hudson" normally does.

Handy for doing a "one time" aggregation, such as for 
a "patched repo". 

If these scripts are for, say "lunalimited", then they would 
be exported (copyied, or scp copied) to /shared/simrel/lunalimited.

These are in addition to the normal "bootstrap" files, 
getRelengTools.sh and getRelengTests.sh, each of which 
would be ran first, say, with 
release=lunalimited ./getRelengTools.sh
and 
release=lunalimited ./getRelengTests.sh

Then 
./installTools.sh
./installtests.sh
and finally 
./aggLunaLimited.sh


The "promoteToReleases.sh" file is here, since is shows how 
I had to change it, to promote directly from the build machine, 
to the "releases" directory. (Normally we "promote" from "staging" 
directory). Seems in an ideal world ... it would be easier!
