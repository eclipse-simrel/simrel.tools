1. There is some "by hand" prep done, where
old, not-in-use composite repo jar files (created in item '2') are removed.
We do not remove them when promoted, since that would change directory time stamp,
and cause the mirroring system to think nothing was mirrored yet.

2. We hand create the composite repo jars.
The ant or API methods only create the "official names" --
we want some named so that they are not used, yet, but
then we rename (actually copy) them when made visible. (Since nothing,
at that point, is deleted or added the parent directory
does not change time stamps).


3. There is a "last step" "makeVisiible.sh" when the repository is "made visible".
A script is ran that copies the preliminary name to the official names.
This should (and does) be tied to "EPP" to make its repository visible, but currently there
are some "hard coded" values for "neon".

4. There is, now, an automatic "sanity check repo" check which just "list IUs".
Its purpose is primarily to make sure the sure the repo meets its "atomic" criteria.
In future, we should add other checks, normally done by hand, such as install "just the platform"
and then make sure "xml editor" (or similar) can be installed too (and pulls in what ever it needs.
"Success or failure" might be hard to measure (if it does not fail outright) but could probably "count plugins" or
similar to make sure "obtained" equaled "expected".
