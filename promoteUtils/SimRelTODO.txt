1. There is some "by hand" prep done, where 
old, not-in-use repositories are removed.
 
  We do not remove them when promoted, since that would change directory time stamp, 
  and cause the mirroring system to think nothing was mirrored yet. 
  
2. We hand create the composite repo jars. 
The ant or API methods only create the "official names" -- 
we want some named so that they are not used, yet, but 
then we rename them when made visible. (Since nothing, 
at that point, is deleted or added the parent directory 
does not change time stamps). 


3. There is a "last step" "makeVisiible.sh" when the repository is "made visible". A script is ran that copies the preliminary name to the official names. 

4. Should an an automatic repo check which would just "list IUs" 
just to make sure it meets "atomic" criteria.
