When a build fails because "Not all artifacts could be mirrored", it is sometimes hard to find,
in the log of thousands of mirror messages, which ones could not be mirrored. So this file, it so
list observed "key phrases" to search for.

First, the log "concludes with"
 [exec] Build failed! Exception was org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Not all artifacts could be mirrored, see log for details
 [exec] Not all artifacts could be mirrored, see log for details

Specific cases can ususally be found be searching for:

Unable to mirror artifact

Sometimes followed by
Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
[If this one seen, might be worth "trying again"?]
