This p2.index files are created by recent versions of b3.aggregator, 
for Juno, but this copy is provided for reference and use in earlier 
repositories, such as subrepos under .../releases/indigo/<datestamp>/
There, typically, we have one compositeArtifacts.jar but a simple content.jar.

Note we purposely do not put p2.index file in .../releases/indigo/<datestamp>/aggregate/
since does not really help save anything in that case as there is only artifacts.jar, 
which happens to be looked for first anyway.
